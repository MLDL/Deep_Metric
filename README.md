#### [A Metric Learning Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08505.pdf)

from Cornell Tech and Facebook AI

Abstract: Deep metric learning papers from the past four years have consistently claimed great advances in accuracy, often more than doubling the performance of decade-old methods. In this paper, we take a closer look at the field to see if this is actually true. We find flaws in the experimental setup of these papers, and propose a new way to evaluate metric learning algorithms. Finally, we present experimental results that show that the improvements over time have been marginal at best.
   
  　　
   
### XBM: A New Sota method for DML, accepted by CVPR-2020 as Oral:

### [Cross-Batch Memory for Embedding Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06798.pdf) 

  - #### Great Improvement: XBM can improve the R@1 by 12~25% on three large-scale datasets

  - #### Easy to implement: with only several lines of codes

  - #### Memory efficient: with less than 1GB for large-scale datasets
 
  - #### Code has already been released: [xbm](https://github.com/MalongTech/research-ms-loss/blob/master/ret_benchmark/modeling/xbm.py)

### MS Loss based on GPW: Accepted by CVPR 2019 as Poster 
### [Multi-Similarity Loss with General Pair Weighting for Deep Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06627.pdf) 
  - #### [code released link](https://github.com/MalongTech/research-ms-loss)
  - #### [New Version of paper ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06627.pdf), To make my idea to be understand easily, I have rewritten the major part of my paper recently to make it clear. (at 2020-03-24)
  

 
 　
### Deep metric methods implemented in this repositories:

- Contrasstive Loss [1]

- Semi-Hard Mining Strategy [2] 

- Lifted Structure Loss* [3] (Modified version because of its original weak performance) 

- Binomial BinDeviance Loss [4]

- NCA Loss [6]

- Multi-Similarity Loss [7]

### Dataset
- [Car-196](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_devkit.tgz)

   first 98 classes as train set and last 98 classes as test set

- [CUB-200-2011](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200/images.tgz)

  first 100 classes as train set and last 100 classes as test set

- [Stanford-Online-Products](ftp://cs.stanford.edu/cs/cvgl/Stanford_Online_Products.zip)
  
  for the experiments, we split 59,551 images of 11,318 classes for training and 60,502 images of 11,316 classes for testing

- [In-Shop-clothes-Retrieval](ftp://cs.stanford.edu/cs/cvgl/Stanford_Online_Products.zip)
  
    For the In-Shop Clothes Retrieval dataset, 3,997 classes with 25,882 images for training.
    And the test set are partitioned to query set with 3,985 classes(14,218 images) and gallery set with 3,985 classes (12,612 images).

- [Processed CUB and Cars196](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LPHi72JPupkvUy_1OIn6yA)
  
    Extract code: inmj
   
    To easily reimplement the performance, I provide the processed datasets: CUB and Cars-196.
